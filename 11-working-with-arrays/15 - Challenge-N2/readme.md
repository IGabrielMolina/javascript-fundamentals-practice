This is challenge #2

Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
Your tasks:
Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:

```javascript
/*
1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
   <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 x dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
   humanAge = 16 + dogAge x 4

2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
   keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)

3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
   from other challenges how we calculate averages �)
4. Run the function for both test datasets

   Test data:
   § Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
   § Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
   GOOD LUCK �
   */
```

I have decided that logging my chain of tought is extremely unproductive if I take in consideration the time spent doing so, time which would be better invested in studying in itself, so starting from this point I will only document the code I wrote in each lesson and the main takeaways, just so my reasoning and learning process is readable in a concise, brief, and efficient manner.

For this challenge, I learned how to use filter, map, sets, and I also shained said methods, aaand I also played around with ArrayFrom even tho you won't see it in this code, since it is not a part of the challenge

Thanks for reading!

edit: I learned chaining while doing this challenge because I wanted a more efficient way of writing this code adnd I found out about chaining, but as it turns out that was the content of class 15 and 16 challenge #3 haha, so yeah, Next folder will be chapter 17 OH IT's the find method I'VE BEEN WAITING for this one!

thanks again for taking an interest on my learning journey, and see you in the next readme!
