Equality checks if the array has a certain value

```javascript
// EUALITY
console.log(movements.includes(-130));

// SOME: checks if something meets a condition
console.log(movements.some(mov => mov === -130));

// EVERY: Every single item meet the condition?
console.log(account4.movements.every(mov => mov > 0));
```

You don't neccesarily need to write the whole callback function

you can write the callback function apart and call it:

```javascript

```
